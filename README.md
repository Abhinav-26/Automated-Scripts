# Automated-Scripts
In this repository I will upload some of the automated scripts which I have created to automate the boring tasks. Automation is Industry in Demand Technology and there have been several tools practises for making things automated. <b>DevOps</b> is one such technology for automating lots of stuffs.<br>

<b>1. DockerSetup.py</b><br>
In this python file I have created a script which will automatically download and configure the docker in your system. This is only for linux operating systems. <br>

<b>NOTE :</b> I have not used the concepts of error handling but soon will add some use-cases in the script for better performance.<br>

<b>2. NmapScanner.py </b><br>
In this python script I have used the concepts of conditional statements and commands of nmap. This script I have created just to enhance my skills and recall the concepts of nmap-scanner. It consists of 10 different types of nmap scans for which we need to remember the commands but this script will help me to just launch the scans without mugging up the commands for every other task.

<b>NOTE :</b> I haven't checked for the all the tasks mentioned in the menu. So if any ERROR comes please dm me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinavdubey26/">LinkedIn Profile</a>.<br>

<b>3. ImageNaming.py</b><br>
In this python file I have created a auto-naming script which I use to filter the data for training espically to work with images. you just need to mention the directory path in which images are present and it will satrting naming those images in a proper way. By default it will satrt with 1.jpg, 2.jpg,... and so on. It can useful for such use cases. I have used the OS module of Python for creating this.<br>

<b>4. MailSender.py</b><br>
In this python file I have created a mail-sending script.
