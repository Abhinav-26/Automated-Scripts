# Automated-Scripts
In this repository I will upload some of the automated scripts which I have created to automate the boring tasks. Automation is Industry in Demand Technology and there have been several tools practises for making things automated. <b>DevOps</b> is one such technology for automating lots of stuffs.<br>

<b>1. DockerSetup.py</b> : In this python file I have created a script which will automatically download and configure the docker in your system. This is only for linux operating systems. <br>

<b>Note :</b>I have used concepts of error handling for building this tool. It's very simple tool, but I will add some use-cases in the script for better performance.
